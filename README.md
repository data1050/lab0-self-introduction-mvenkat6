Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

I am a first year masters student in the DSI program and I am from Doylestown, PA.
My favorite food is sushi.
My undergraduate background is in Aerospace engineering from Georgia Tech, and some of my favorite topics from those courses were orbital mechanics and robotics.
